# Knapsack problem

## Basic Knapsack problem
The goal is to maximize the value of items packed
The knapsack can take a max weight of limit kg
This example can be used for going camping or a plan trip
or anywhere there is a limit for the total weight

Have n items 1..n, each of which weighs w_i kg and has value v_i
The problem is to find which items to carry to maximize the total value
The total value is the sum of v_i for the selected items
The sum of w_i cannot exceed the max weight, which is limit kg


## Multi-dimensional Knapsack problem
This is the same as the basic knapsack problem, with additional constraints
For example, the knapsack has a max weight and a max volume
Another example is that we are allowed up to k items, in addition to the max weight and max volume


## Multi-Knapsack problem
Here there can be multiple knapsacks, each with their own limits
We need to maximize the items taken
Each item can be carried in only one knapsack
